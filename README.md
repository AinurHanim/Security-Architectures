# Security-Architectures

Here I have included a project that needed to be done when I was in semester 6 in Security Architecture subject. This project requires student to design a secure network using Packet Tracer, focusing on the implementation of the Domains of Trust principle. It also require students to create distinct domains within the network with varying trust levels and incorporate
security measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
